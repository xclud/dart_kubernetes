/// Sidecar describes the configuration of the sidecar proxy that mediates inbound and outbound communication to the
/// workload instance it is attached to. By default, Istio will program all sidecar proxies in the mesh with the necessary
/// configuration required to reach every workload instance in the mesh, as well as accept traffic on all the ports associated
/// with the workload. The Sidecar configuration provides a way to fine tune the set of ports, protocols that the proxy will accept
/// when forwarding traffic to and from the workload. In addition, it is possible to restrict the set of services that the proxy can
/// reach when forwarding outbound traffic from workload instances.
///
/// Services and configuration in a mesh are organized into one or more namespaces (e.g., a Kubernetes namespace or a CF org/space).
/// A Sidecar configuration in a namespace will apply to one or more workload instances in the same namespace, selected using the
/// workloadSelector field. In the absence of a workloadSelector, it will apply to all workload instances in the same namespace.
/// When determining the Sidecar configuration to be applied to a workload instance, preference will be given to the resource with
/// a workloadSelector that selects this workload instance, over a Sidecar configuration without any workloadSelector.
///
/// NOTE 1: Each namespace can have only one Sidecar configuration without any workloadSelector that specifies the default for all pods in that namespace.
/// It is recommended to use the name default for the namespace-wide sidecar.
/// The behavior of the system is undefined if more than one selector-less Sidecar configurations exist in a given namespace.
/// The behavior of the system is undefined if two or more Sidecar configurations with a workloadSelector select the same workload instance.
///
/// NOTE 2: A Sidecar configuration in the MeshConfig root namespace will be applied by default to all namespaces without a Sidecar configuration.
/// This global default Sidecar configuration should not have any workloadSelector.
