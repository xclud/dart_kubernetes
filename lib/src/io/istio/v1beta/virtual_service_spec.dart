  /// A single VirtualService can be used to describe all the traffic properties of the corresponding hosts,

  /// details.

  /// Note for Kubernetes users: When short names are used
  /// (e.g. “reviews” instead of “reviews.default.svc.cluster.local”),
  /// Istio will interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule,
  /// not the service. A rule in the “default” namespace containing a host “reviews” will be
  /// interpreted as “reviews.default.svc.cluster.local”, irrespective of the actual namespace
  /// associated with the reviews service. To avoid potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to
  /// always use fully qualified domain names over short names.
