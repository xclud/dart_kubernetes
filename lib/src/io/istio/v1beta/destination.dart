/// registry. Istio’s service registry is composed of all the services found in the platform’s service
/// registry (e.g., Kubernetes services, Consul services), as well as services declared through the
/// [ServiceEntry] resource.

/// Note for Kubernetes users: When short names are used
/// (e.g. “reviews” instead of “reviews.default.svc.cluster.local”),
