/// Peer authentication policies specify the mutual TLS mode Istio enforces on target workloads. The following modes are supported:
///
/// - PERMISSIVE: Workloads accept both mutual TLS and plain text traffic. This mode is most useful during migrations when workloads
/// without sidecar cannot use mutual TLS. Once workloads are migrated with sidecar injection, you should switch the mode to STRICT.
/// - STRICT: Workloads only accept mutual TLS traffic.
/// - DISABLE: Mutual TLS is disabled. From a security perspective, you shouldnâ€™t use this mode unless you provide your own security solution.
///
/// When the mode is unset, the mode of the parent scope is inherited. Mesh-wide peer authentication policies with an unset mode
/// use the PERMISSIVE mode by default.
